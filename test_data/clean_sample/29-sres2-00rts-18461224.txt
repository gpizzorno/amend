Nothing in the constitution, or in any amendment which has been made thereto, shall be construed to authorize or empower the judicial department of the government of the United States to declare any act of Congress, or of any State legislature, to be void, on the ground that such act is contrary to the constitution of the United States, or contrary to the constitution of any particular State; but such power shall be held to have been reserved to the States and the people in their sovereign capacity.
