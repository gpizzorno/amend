at least a two-thirds majority of the States, have, pursuant

in such manner as the Congress may by law provide, at the
next election for presidential electors occurring more than
ninety days after the adoption of the proposal by a two-
thirds majority of the States and not thereafter. If a
majority of the people voting on such amendment in such
election, in each of at least three-fourths of the States, vote
favorably thereon, it shall be valid to all intents and pur-
poses as part of this Constitution to the same extent as
