term, be elected as follows:
“Each State shall be entitled to a number of electoral
votes equal to the whole number of Senators and Representa-
tives to which the State shall be entitled in Congress.”
The first division of the Twelfth Amendment to the Con-
stitution, ending with the words “directed to the President of
the Senate” to be stricken out and the following substituted:
“The citizens of each State who shall be qualified to
vote for Representatives in Congress shall cast their votes
for candidates for President and Vice-President by ballot, and
proper returns of the votes so cast shall be made under seal
I
within ten days to the secretary of state or other officer law-
fully performing the duties of such secretary in the govern-
ment of the State, by whom the said returns shall be publicly
opened in the presence of the chief executive magistrate of
the State and of the chief justice or judge of the highest court
thereof; and the said secretary, chief executive magistrate, and
judge shall assign to each candidate voted for by a sufficient
number of citizens a proportionate part of the electoral votes to
which the State shall be entitled, in manner following, that is
to say: They shall divide the whole number of votes returned
by the whole number of the State’s electoral vote, and the
resulting quotient shall be the electoral ratio for the State, and
shall assign to candidates voted for one electoral vote for each
ratio of popular votes received by them, respectively, and, if
necessary, additional electoral votes for successive largest
fractions of a ratio shall be assigned to candidates voted for,
until the whole number of the electoral votes of the State shall
be distributed; and the said officers'shall thereupon make up
and certify at least three general returns, comprising the popular
vote by counties, parishes, or other principal divisions of the
State, and their apportionment of electoral votes as aforesaid,
and shall transmit two thereof, under seal, to the seat of
Government of the United States, one directed to the Presi-
dent of the Senate and one to the Speaker of the House of
Representatives, and a third unsealed return shall be forthwith
filed by the said secretary in his office, be recorded therein,
and be at all times open to inspection. All contests as to the
popular vote of a State thus cast for President and Vice-Presi-
dent shall be determined in accordance with the provisions of
a statute provided by the law-making power of such State.”
Article two, section two, clause four, to be made to read
as follows:
“The Congress may determine the time of voting for
President and Vice-President, and the time of assigning elec-
toral votes to candidates voted for, which times shall be uniform
throughout the United States.”
Strike out the words “electors appointed” where they
occur in the Twelfth Amendment to the Constitution, and suh
stitute in their stead the words “electoral votes.”
