39th CONGRESS,
2d Session.
II. R. 956.
IN THE SENATE OF THE UNITED STATES.
January 11, 1867.
Read twice and referred to the Committee on the Judiciary.
A BILL
To enforce the thirteenth amendment of the Constitution of the
United States.
Whereas the Congress of the United States, at the second session
of the thirty-eighth Congress, proposed to the several States
for adoption the thirteenth amendment of the Constitution,
which has now, by ratification of three-fourths of the States
of the Union, become part of the Constitution, and which by
its terms forever prohibits slavery or involuntary servitude,
“except as a punishment for crime, whereof the party shall
have been duly convicted; ” and whereas in some parts of
this Union it is wrongfully asserted and maintained that, not-
withstanding said amendment, it is lawful to sell or otherwise
commit into unofficial subjection and slavery the persons who
may be convicted of offences against the law, by reason
whereof certain inferior tribunals have adjudged free citizens
of the United States to be so disposed of as to re-establish
chattel slavery for life, or for years, against the principles of
the Christian religion, of civilization, and of the Constitution
of the United States, which now recognizes no involuntary
servitude, except to the law and to the officers of its adminis-
tration: Now, therefore,

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled
That any person or persons who shall hereafter sell, or offer
for sale, or attempt to sell, any person or persons whomso-
ever, within the limits of the United States, or who shall
make or issue any order for such sale, or who shall in any
wise participate in such sale or attempted sale, or who shall
hereafter hold in servitude any person so sold, shall be held
to be guilty of a felony, and shall, upon conviction thereof,
be imprisoned for a period of time not exceeding ten years,
or fined in a sum not exceeding ten thousand dollars, or both,
in the discretion of the court by which such offender shall be
tried.
Passed the House of Representatives January 8,1867.
