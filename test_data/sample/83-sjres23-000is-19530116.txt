“Sec. 2. The Congress shall have power to lay and col-
lect taxes on incomes, from whatever source derived, without
apportionment among the several States, and without regard
to any census or enumeration. The maximum top rate (a
term which shall mean the aggregate of all top rates) of
all taxes, duties, and excises which the Congress may lay or
collect on, with respect to; or measured by, income shall not
exceed 25 per centum: Provided, however, That the Con-
gress by a vote of three fourths of all the members of each
House may fix such a maximum top rate in excess of 25
per centum, for periods, either successive or otherwise, not
exceeding one year each, if such rate so fixed does not ex-
ceed the lowest rate (a term which shall mean the aggregate
of all lowest rates) by more than fifteen percentage points.
. . . . \
Subject to the foregoing limitations, the rates of tax ap-
plicable to the incomes of individuals may be different from
the rates applicable to the incomes of corporations, which
term shall include also associations, joint stock companies,
and insurance companies. The determination of income
subject to tax shall be by uniform rules of general applica-
tion which shall not vary with the size of the income.
Sec. 3. The Congress shall have no power to lay 'or
collect any tax, duty, or excise with respect to the devolution
or transfer of property, or any interest therein, upon or in
